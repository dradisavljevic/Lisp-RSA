# RSA implementation in Common Lisp

Implementaiton of the RSA algorithm in common lisp.

Load both the prime-numbers.lisp and rsa-kzi.lisp files, as RSA requires helper functions defined in prime-numbers.lisp.

Implementation also uses the ascii-string-to-byte-array function implemented in the Ironclad package.

Recommended that before usage ironclad implementation is either loaded or that ironclad is installed through quicklisp.

Couple of different RSA functions are defined within the rsa-kzi.lisp file.

Work is still in progress and algorithm certainly needs a few improvements.
