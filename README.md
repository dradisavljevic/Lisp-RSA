# RSA implementation in Common Lisp

Implementaiton of the RSA algorithm in common lisp.

Load both the prime-numbers.lisp and rsa-kzi.lisp files, as RSA requires helper functions defined in prime-numbers.lisp.

Couple of different RSA functions are defined within the rsa-kzi.lisp file.

Work is still in progress and algorithm certainly needs a few improvements.
